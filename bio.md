Name: Shae Judge
Bio: My previous degree was in Exercise Science.
Even though I took a career turn, I'm still passionate about exercise.
Someday I hope to merge my two passions, computers and exercise.
Some hobbies include running, weight lifting, video games, movies, and comic books.
Programming is really satisfying to me...when it works!
